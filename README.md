In present era of digitally connected world every shopping mall desires to know the customer demands beforehand to avoid the shortfall of sale items in all seasons. Day to day the companies or the malls are predicting more accurately the demand of product sales or user demands. 

We started with making some hypothesis about the data without looking at it. Then we moved on to data exploration where we found out some nuances in the data which required remediation. Next, we performed data cleaning and feature engineering, where we imputed missing values and solved other irregularities, made new features and also made the data model-friendly by one-hot-coding. Finally we made linear regression, decision tree model ,random forest model and xgboost got a glimpse of how to tune them for better results.
